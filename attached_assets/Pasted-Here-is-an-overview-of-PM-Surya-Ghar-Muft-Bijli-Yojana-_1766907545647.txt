Here is an overview of PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana (PM Suryaghar) — and what is known so far about its implementation/status in Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana (TS).

✅ What is PM Surya Ghar

PM Surya Ghar is a nationwide scheme launched on 15 February 2024 by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). 

Aim: to install rooftop solar panels on 1 crore households by 2027, allowing them to generate their own electricity — reducing dependence on conventional grid power, lowering electricity bills, and promoting clean energy. 

Total budget/allocated outlay is ₹75,021 crore. 


Key Benefits under the scheme

Subsidy for rooftop solar installation: For residential houses, subsidy is available (see details below). 

Households may get up to 300 units of “free” electricity per month — i.e. electricity from the rooftop solar panels which reduces their grid electricity use. 

Option to sell surplus electricity (if generated more than household needs) back to the grid — helping households earn additional income. 

Low-interest loans are also offered (in addition to subsidy), easing upfront cost burden. 


Subsidy / Eligibility Structure

According to the official/fairly recent guidelines: 

Rooftop Solar System Capacity	Subsidy (per kW) / Subsidy details

Up to 2 kW	₹ 30,000 per kW 
From 2 kW up to 3 kW	Additional ₹ 18,000 per kW (i.e. total up to ₹ 78,000 subsidy) 
> 3 kW	Maximum cap — subsidy remains at ₹ 78,000. 


Eligibility broadly: Indian households owning a house with rooftop suitable for solar installation, with valid electricity connection. The scheme targets poor and middle-income households. 

Application is through the national portal: https://pmsuryaghar.gov.in 

Implementation period runs till March 2027.

📍 Implementation in Andhra Pradesh

The scheme is active in Andhra Pradesh — many households have already availed rooftop solar systems under PM Suryaghar. 

As of 2025, under APEPDCL (Eastern Power Distribution Company), 10,000 rooftop solar units have been installed under PM Suryaghar across its distribution area. Total installed capacity: about 33,556 kW (i.e. ~33.5 MW), and around ₹77 crore in Central Financial Assistance (subsidy) has been disbursed. 

In a recent push, APEPDCL signed an agreement to install rooftop solar plants in 44,998 homes belonging to Scheduled Caste / Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) families across seven divisions of the state with combined capacity ~90 MW. 

More broadly, across 11 districts in Andhra Pradesh, over 31,000 rooftop solar units have been commissioned under PM Suryaghar, totaling ~100 MW capacity. 

The scheme in AP appears to be contributing to reduction in grid electricity dependence, and is being used by households to generate their own electricity (and possibly sell surplus). 


Challenges/Progress Notes (AP):

The uptake has been significant among households (especially under APEPDCL), including SC/ST households. 

Subsidies + net-metering / grid connectivity + vendor network + awareness campaigns have helped.

📍 Implementation & Status in Telangana

The scheme is present officially in Telangana: TELANGANA STATE RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (TSREDCO) appears in vendor / scheme documents for PM-Surya Ghar in the state. 

Subsidy structure in Telangana under PM Surya Ghar mirrors the central scheme: ₹ 30,000/kW up to 2 kW; additional ₹ 18,000 per kW for up to 3 kW; total cap ₹ 78,000. 

However, uptake in Telangana is reportedly low: there are media reports that many households are not showing interest in the scheme — lack of awareness, apprehensions about installation or performance are cited as reasons. 

Implementation challenges have been highlighted: administrative hurdles, lower subsidy take-up, perhaps weaker vendor outreach or lack of community awareness — all affecting the rollout. 


So, while the scheme is valid and operational in Telangana, its adoption seems much lower than in some other states (like AP), and progress appears slow.

🔎 What this means for households / what you should check (if you are interested)

If you or someone you know in Andhra Pradesh or Telangana wants to benefit from PM Surya Ghar:

Check if your house has a rooftop suitable for solar panels and if you have a valid electricity connection.

Visit the official portal (pmsuryaghar.gov.in) and register your application with required documents — Aadhaar, electricity consumer number, address, roof details, etc. 

Choose a vendor from the approved list; installation, testing, commissioning are handled by them.

After approval, solar panels get installed; you get subsidy (direct to bank account) and then you start consuming solar electricity — up to 300 units/month — potentially zero electricity bills.

If you generate surplus electricity, you may sell/discharge it back to grid (depending on local DISCOM / net-metering rules).

⚠️ What’s uncertain / What to monitor

In Telangana: very low adoption — possibly due to awareness or administrative delays. 

The subsidy cap (₹ 78,000) may not cover full cost of solar installation beyond certain capacity — so consumer may bear some upfront cost (or take a loan). 

Availability of registered/empanelled vendors in your area may affect ease and speed of installation.

Net-metering or ability to sell surplus to grid depends on local DISCOM regulations.

If you like — I can check current(2025) status** of PM Surya Ghar in Andhra Pradesh + Telangana — number of applications vs installations, capacity installed vs target.
Do you want me to build that report for you now?
describe my idea 
keeping all the data here and in reference to Nature welfare Council website I need a prompt which to put it in repplit to build a end to end application.
