4) PM SURYA GHAR PAGE ("/pm-surya-ghar")
--------------------------------------------
Explain PM Surya Ghar scheme clearly using user-friendly text.

Important points to include:
- Launched by MNRE in Feb 2024.
- Goal: rooftop solar for 1 crore homes by March 2027.
- Benefits:
  - Up to 300 units/month “free” via solar generation.
  - Reduced dependence on DISCOM bills.
  - Option to sell surplus power to grid (net-metering).
  - Central subsidy directly to beneficiary’s bank.
  - Low-interest loans (~7%) without collateral for up to 3 kW.

Subsidy slab table (as HTML table):
- 0–2 kW: ₹30,000 per kW
- 2–3 kW: additional ₹18,000 per kW
- Above 3 kW: total subsidy capped at ₹78,000

Note: Important disclaimer:
- Final eligibility and approval decisions are made by the government; UdGEM only provides guidance, awareness and support.

=============================
Subsidy Calculator (on this page)
=============================
Implement calculator UI and logic:

Inputs:
- `avg_units` (Average monthly consumption in units)
- `capacity_kw` (Desired system size in kW, float allowed)

On “Calculate” button click:
- Use simple matching rules:
  - If avg_units <= 150 → recommended 1–2 kW
  - 150 < avg_units <= 300 → recommended 2–3 kW
  - >300 → recommended >3 kW (cap at subsidy maximum)
- Subsidy calculation logic:
  - If capacity_kw <= 2:
      subsidy = 30000 * capacity_kw
  - If 2 < capacity_kw <= 3:
      subsidy = 30000 * 2 + 18000 * (capacity_kw - 2)
  - If capacity_kw > 3:
      subsidy = 30000 * 2 + 18000 * 1   (cap = 78,000)
- Display:
  - “Recommended system size” message based on units
  - “Estimated subsidy: ₹XX,XXX”
  - Short explanation string

Implementation details:
- Do calculation in main.js using JS, no page reload.
- If invalid input (blank or negative), show Bootstrap alert.

--------------------------------------------
5) AP & TS STATUS PAGE ("/ap-ts-status")
--------------------------------------------
This page summarizes implementation status in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana based on provided brief.

Structure:

Section 1: Intro

  - Plan for ~44,998 SC/ST households with ~90 MW.
  - Overall ~100 MW rooftop solar across 11 districts (approximate).
  - Mention positive adoption, awareness efforts, SC/ST focus.

Section 3: Telangana (TS)
- Highlight:
  - Scheme exists and TSREDCO is the nodal body.
  - Same subsidy structure as central scheme.
